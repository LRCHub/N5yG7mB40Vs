One day away from you, I'm feeling
something new,
The way you look at me says everything.
It's much too late to hide, what's building up inside,
Hot blood is rushing through my heart and soul.

Chorus:
Love is the strongest emotion,
No-one can stop what we do.
Love is the strongest emotion,
That you'll ever feelwhen your love is real.

I've been awake all night, my eyes are open wide,
I never dreamed you, you're no fantasy.
Oh, don't make me wait too long,
Cause you're the only one girl you change my
wishes to reality

Repeat chorus

And I wanna touch, and I wanna feel,
What you do to me.
Cause nothing on earth can move me like you,
Come on baby show mecause I need to give my
love to you.

I wanna touch, and I wanna feel,
What you do to me.
Cause, nothing on earth can move me like you,
Come on baby show me, cause Ineed to
give my love.

Love is the strongest emotion,
No-one can stopwhat we do.
Love is the strongest emotion,
That you'll ever feel when you know
your love is real.
